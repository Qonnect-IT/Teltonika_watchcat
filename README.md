# Teltonika_watchcat
Teltonika Custom watchcat

This repository was made to hold a custom variant of the Watchcat program by segal.di.ubi.pt.

Teltonika routers are running a custom version of OpenWRT, therefor not all programs can be used natively on Teltonika devices. This Watchcat version is made to replace the one already available on the Teltonika router version RUT 240.

## Config template

the file ```watchcat.config``` holds a template for configuring Watchcat. The file uses parameters as specified on https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/advanced/watchcat

## Tested firmware versions

RUT_2XX_R-00.01.14.5
